# Brief Project Overview

In this project I:

0. Cleaned and preprocessed the data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which "regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information."  
1. Used a mix-data type clustering algorithm to segment repondents of the HINTS survey.
2. Tested classification algorithms (Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost) to see how well they can predict patients that hold fatalistic views (or not) regarding cancer.
