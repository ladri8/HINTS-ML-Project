# Project Overview

In this project I:

0. Cleaned and preprocessed the data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which "regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publicâ€™s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information."  
1. Tested classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to see how well they can predict people that hold fatalistic views (or not) regarding cancer. 
2. Used a mix-data type clustering algorithm to segment repondents of the HINTS survey.
